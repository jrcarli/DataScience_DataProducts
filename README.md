# Coffee Brewing Methods

This is a simple Shiny app to display coffee brewing instructions. 
It allows the user to specify the units (either grams or ounces) and the number of servings (from one to four).
The interface will automatically update with correct values based on a standard ratio of coffee to water for each recipe.
